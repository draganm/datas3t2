# Cucumber Feature File Best Practices

Feature files should follow these best practices for clarity and maintainability:

## Each Scenario Must Follow a Single Given-When-Then Flow

Every scenario should have exactly one flow of Given → When → Then steps:

- **Given**: Sets up the preconditions (can have multiple with "And")
- **When**: Describes a single action being performed (only one per scenario)
- **Then**: Verifies the expected outcome (can have multiple with "And")

## Avoid

- Multiple When/Then sequences in a single scenario:
  ```gherkin
  Given a precondition
  When I do action 1
  Then I see result 1
  When I do action 2   # Bad: Second "When" in the same scenario
  Then I see result 2
  ```

## Prefer

- Single When/Then sequence in each scenario:
  ```gherkin
  Given a precondition
  When I do action 1
  Then I see result 1
  
  # New scenario for the second action
  Scenario: Description of second action
  Given a precondition
  When I do action 2
  Then I see result 2
  ```

- Using Background for common setup steps
